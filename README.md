# FruitPunch AI Code epoch 7: Monte Carlo methods

AI Code is an initiative by fruitpunch where students can learn to apply AI together by solving a challenge under 
supervision of an expert. This repository contains the challenge files for epoch 7.

# Challenge description

Monte Carlo (MC) methods are indispensable for any data scientist’s toolbox. 
They have wide-ranging applications from finance to physics, from law to AI. 
DeepMind’s AlphaGo used MC based algorithms ([paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961)) to beat Lee Sedol in Go. 
This week you will be presented with several challenges to solve using MC methods.

This challenge is prepared by [Mehmet Alican Noyan](https://github.com/MehmetAlicanNoyan).
